# Canine-tooth-biomechanics-BeamTheory-FinitieElementAnalysis

In this R-code and accompanying datafiles we calculate single summary maximum stress values from Beam Theory Analysis and Finitie Element Analysis output
and look for correlations between aspects of canine tooth shape and stress. This dataset consists of an R-project and all accompanying .csv files necessary to run the analyses including some figure creation complete with annotation. To use: All files should be downloaded and placed in a single folder. Then the Rproj opened, and the Rmd file opened and run. All files are required to run the code.

All data manipulation and analysis was performed using RStudio statistical and graphical environment (R version 4.0.3, RStudio version 1.3.1093).
